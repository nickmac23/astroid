Thank you for you interest in Asteroid Field, my Galvanized G20 front end project. My game is a remake of Atari's Asteroids, an arcade style game in which a spaceship fights for survival in an asteroid field. My version was made entirely using HTML5 canvas element and JavaScript for gameplay as well as CSS, SASS and Jquery for site styling. The game includes four ships that can be used in gameplay, three asteroid types with different behavior and an updating score tally that gets saved to local storage. The API that is included in this site is Firebase's data storage which I utilized for creating a high score ladder board. With Firebase I am able to save high scores generated from any browser and compare them to all other high scores. Top 5 scores are then displayed in order on screen. I hope you enjoy the game.
